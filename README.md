# VideoSwitch 🎬

VideoSwitch is a simple and elegant video control widget built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It features a responsive play/pause toggle button with animated UI feedback, and a preloader that hides automatically once the video data is ready.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔁 Toggle play and pause with a single switch
- 🎨 Active state highlighting for "Play" and "Pause"
- ⚡ Smooth UI transitions and animations
- ⏳ Preloader that disappears when video is ready
- 🚫 No external libraries required

## 🚀 How It Works

- The switch button toggles a `.slide` class when clicked.
- The position and color of the button animate using CSS transitions.
- JavaScript listens for video readiness and button clicks to control playback.
- The currently active state (`Play` or `Pause`) is visually highlighted using color (`#49a6e9`).
