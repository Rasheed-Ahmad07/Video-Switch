# Video-Switch
VideoSwitch is a lightweight and interactive web component that allows users to seamlessly toggle video playback using a visually engaging switch button. It includes a smooth transition animation, a preloader for improved UX during video loading, and dynamic highlighting of active states (play/pause) â€” all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
